Whether you're a seasoned surfer or just starting out, SurfNow has got your back. Let's dive in!

## What's This All About?

SurfNow is a Node.js app built with TypeScript and NestJS. It checks surf conditions at various beaches and notifies users when the waves are just right. No more guessing or missing out on those perfect surf days!

## Features

- **Customizable Alerts**: Set your own criteria for wave height and get notified when conditions match.
- **Email & SMS Notifications**: Receive alerts via email and text message.
- **Opt-Out Option**: Don't want notifications? No problem, you can opt out anytime.

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**: Because type safety is cool.
- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **npm**: For managing dependencies.
- **Beachcam API**: For fetching real-time surf conditions.
